            <p>The library should follow the guidelines established by the institution
closely, adhering to accessible Web pages, a toll-free line for reference
requests, appropriate mechanisms for borrowing privileges (which should be
longer for distance students than on-site students)—and clear points of
contact and information. Libraries would be wise to employ a full-time
distance education librarian4
 who serves actively throughout the institution on
committees and curriculum groups. The distance education librarian must be
able to coordinate resources, services, and materials, as well as serve a liaison
between students and computer resources. He or she will be conversant with
the “techies” but also able to articulate clearly to students who may need
assistance with the technological aspects of library use. The distance education librarian should hold virtual bibliographic instruction sessions at the
inception of each semester. These sessions should be videotaped or digitally
recorded so students are comfortably literate with the library and its online
resources; these should be available for circulation, ensuring multiple copies
are available, or download. Finally, libraries must be committed to implementing a synchronous chat room and email line for ready reference and other
“quick” questions. Services for database searching should be available at a
cost not prohibitive to students.</p>
            <p>With the rapid changes impacting libraries, these strategies may become
quickly obsolete. Librarians are encouraged to keep up with revisions and
announcements from the ACRL, attend distance education conferences, and
remain committed to proactive communication, visibility on campus, and to
serving distance education students with library and information resources in
the best possible ways.</p>
            <center><h2>SUGGESTED TIMELINE FOR INSTITUTIONAL
PLANNING</h2></center>
            <p>In the best scenario, an institution will have close to a year of preparation
time before the inception of courses. This preparation time will allow staff to
be trained and/or hired, marketing and recruitment efforts implemented, and
departments, library and computer services revised and reorganized. Many
institutions of higher education will also need to work with curriculum
committees, accreditation bodies, and graduate schools for online course
approval. This will vary by institution.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, most institutions will not have a year of planning and
preparation. A strategic plan of action is recommended, in which priorities are
established and implementation plans arranged. The strategic plan, which
will impact all layers of the institution and must be coordinated.</p>

            <p>This chapter has offered various strategies for best serving distance
education students. They are certain to change as distance education itself
evolves, but it provides a strategic starting point for planning and implementation of distance education. With the library as an integral component in
student success, various library strategies were described. Each institution
would be wise to consider these strategies, assemble your student advisory
group, and embark on a needs assessment. This will be an ongoing process—
your institutional work will not end once your programs or courses are online.
Consider and maintain the student perspective, for it is the students who will
make or break your distance education initiatives; be ready to embrace
change, and most importantly, embrace the philosophy of distance education.
The challenges will not stop, but you will be armed with solutions and
strategies for efficacious distance education.</p>

            <h1>Quality Assurance of
Online Courses</h1>
            <p>Richard Ryan
University of Oklahoma, USA</p>
            <h2>THE CONCERN ABOUT QUALITY ASSURANCE</h2></center>
            <h4>The Potential to Compromise Quality</h4>
            <p>Today, many university programs are integrating online classes into their
curriculums. According to Stephen Ehrmann, reasons for online course
offerings typically fall into two categories.</p>
            <p><i>One type wanted to use distance learning technology to increase
enrollments, often by reaching out to certain types of people who would
not otherwise get an education. Some reviewers charge that these
proposals were cheating students of most of the support needed for
excellence: laboratories, rich libraries, interactive seminars, and informal interaction on campus.</i></p>
            <p><i>The other type of proposal used computer technology to change what
students learned or how they learned. Some reviewers accused such
proposals of being tiny bastions of expensive exclusivity, hoarding rich
resources for the lucky or the strong, excluding the vast majority of
learners who were most in need of excellent teaching.
In other words, most technology proposals were designed either to
enlarge the number of learners or to improve what some learners could
learn, but not both. (Ehrmann, 1999)</i></p>
            <p>Both objectives, improving access and improving quality, offer
incentive for creation of online classes and degree programs. The benefits
of using the economical Internet for distance learning are just beginning
to be explored and documented. It is almost assured that, as more classes
are offered online and become interchangeable at different universities,
the proliferation of use by students will increase because of the “anywhere, anytime nature” of the Internet.</p>
            <p> anytime online class availability are often the primary reasons students
enroll in online courses. The quality of the online educational experience is
often a secondary consideration to the student. Many times these students are
willing to miss the in-class experience and interaction in order to receive
credit for online coverage of certain required subject matter. Because of this
attitude, there is also the potential for students and potential employers to
perceive an online class or degree program as an “alternative” or the “next best
thing” to attending traditional lecture classes. This attitude needs to be
minimized if students are to utilize online and traditional classes equivalently
in their degrees. The same level of quality for the class experience and content
should be expected if online and traditional lecture classes are to be considered equivalent. Making an online class as engaging as a lecture class using
the Internet is a worthy goal. “Jumping in with both feet is not for timid souls.
Internet offerings require large amounts of time in the preparation of course
materials. Everything must be viewed in a global sense for an entire semester
at the offset.” (Kubala, 1998).</p>
            <p>Assuring that the quality of the online class experience is equivalent to
the traditional lecture class experience, using a medium that embodies
working independently at one’s own pace, and communicating anonymously
is a challenge. In fact, at this current stage of development, it is unproven as
to whether this objective can be achieved. Class administrators and students
must ask themselves, “Is there a trade-off of class quality for the convenience
of the delivery method?” Motivations for offering and taking online classes
should be fully explored. Class quality should not be compromised for the
sake of posting a class online for business reasons, because others are doing
it or for the convenience using the Internet brings. Motivations for offering
online classes should be based in both improving access and quality. Achieving this level of quality will greatly influence online class acceptability across
curriculums and universities, hopefully resulting in better use of classes and
Instructor expertise.</p>
            <p>At this stage of online education development, there is great potential for
the traditional university experience to be reshaped using the Internet.</p>
            <p>Strategies for quality assurance of online offerings must be defined and
implemented if this is to happen. Optimizing use of the Internet to remove the
physical limitations of the traditional university is just beginning. The quality
of online classes will improve as Internet technology advances. As with any
emerging endeavor, programs that implement quality assurance plans for
online class offerings will probably have greater success in this effort.</p>
            <h2>Equal Quality Expectation for Traditional and Online
Construction Classes</h2>
            <p>At the April 1999 National Construction Industry Education Forum
(NCIEF) in Las Vegas, Nevada, discussion focused on quality assurance of
online construction courses. During this discussion between construction
academicians and construction industry representatives, it was agreed that
online construction classes should meet the same quality expectations as
traditional lecture classes. It was further recognized that these expectations
should be evaluated the same way for both types of classes. It was hoped that
all classes in a construction program, regardless of the delivery method,
would be held to the same level of quality expectation. It was further hoped
that by maintaining the same level of quality expectation issues of curriculum
suitability, faculty receiving workload credit and acceptance of class credits
at other universities would be minimized. This would also assure potential
employers in the construction industry that the current education experience
would not be compromised.</p>
            <p>Comparisons of online classes to traditional lecture classes are just being
documented to support this NCIEF discussion. Schulman and Sims (1999)
found that “the learning of the online students is equal to the learning of inclass students,” comparing pre- and post-tests of knowledge for both groups
of participants. This quantitative comparison addresses one of the components of quality assessment—comparison of outcomes or grades. Their
evidence shows that the online learning environment can be as effective as the
traditional lecture environment. Regarding student performance, Dominguez
and Ridley (1999) found that “distance education supporters recognize the
value and necessity of employing the same yardstick to establish the legitimacy of their programs. Institutions that offer distance education programs to
adult learners in any form —from correspondence to web-based courses—
have been honor bound to establish that such courses provide student learning
and content equivalent to that found with campus-based instruction.”</p>
            <p> other component that must be evaluated for quality assurance of a class.
Further discussion about the cns4913online Construction Equipment and Methods classes shows that the online learning environment can be as
effective as the traditional lecture environment. Recognizing that the traditional lecture and online delivery methods can and should be evaluated the
same is a necessary step toward establishing quality expectations for online
construction classes. For online classes to be equivalent to traditional lecture
classes, there must be a quality equivalency of student performance and the
class experience as well.</p>
            <h2>Online Class Quality Assessment Using In-Place Criteria</h2>
            <p>A convenient, efficient and equivalent means of gathering online
class quality assessment is to use criteria already in place for traditional
lecture classes. Most universities have a quality assurance strategy in
place for current course offerings. Along with outcomes assessment, the
online students’ perception of the class experience is measured and used
for quality assurance of the class. This qualitative perception typically
influences the students’ level of interaction, attitude and ultimate feeling
about the class experience. These considerations subsequently affect the
students’ outcome assessments.</p>
            <p>Part of class quality assurance for University of Oklahoma College of
Architecture classes is a subjective student survey taken at the end of each
class offering. Student reaction to the instructor, class content and content
delivery are rated. The results of the survey are to be used by the instructor to
refine and improve the class. Student perceptions of the class are also used as
criteria for the instructor’s yearly faculty evaluation.</p>
            <p>Part of the previously mentioned NCIEF quality assurance discussion
focused on the cns4913online Construction Equipment and Methods classes
offered Spring 1998 and Spring 1999 by the University of Oklahoma (OU)
Construction Science Division (CNS). The classes were the first complete
semester length, online construction classes to be offered to Associated
Schools of Construction member programs. Twenty-five students from nine
geographically separate accredited university construction programs successfully completed the online classes. As part of the lecture and online class
evaluations, the instructor used the OU College of Architecture (CoA) NonStudio Course Evaluation to gather student ratings concerning the course
instructor, course content and student performance. As with traditional
classes, the online students’ perception of the class experience was measured
and used for assessment and improvement of the class. Success of the online
classes was evaluated by comparing traditional lecture and online class
assessments using the Non-Studio Course Evaluation instrument, class
exercise, and exam grades.</p>
            <center><h1>THE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AND
METHODS CLASSES</h1></center>
            <h2>Class Criteria</h2>
            <p>The objective of the CNS 4913, Construction Equipment and Methods class was to provide an overview of different types of construction
equipment and methods. Students investigated different types of equipment, performance criteria, the selection process, the economics of
ownership, and inclusion of equipment costs in the project estimate.
American Council of Construction Education accredited (ACCE) construction programs are encouraged to include this content in their curriculums, though not necessarily in a dedicated class. This class is not part of
the OU CNS “core” of classes, but all CNS students are required to
successfully complete it. Assignments and exams were medium level
difficulty. Correct answers to exercises were determined using algorithmic formula, visual association or procedural understanding. Learning the
formula or process was typically the objective of the exercises and the
correct answer was a product of this understanding. In other problemsolving exercises, assessment was based on the approach to the problem
and the steps of the solution, not just the correct answer. The typical
lecture class atmosphere was open, using student inquiries to drive the
lecture when appropriate. Students typically enjoyed the class because of
the visual-based learning, the overall level of class difficulty, and the
classroom atmosphere.</p>
            <h2>The 1998 Class</h2>
            <p>During the Spring 1998 semester, a web-based online Construction
Equipment and Methods class was taught in conjunction with a 26 student
lecture class meeting twice a week at OU. The online class was administered
from a custom-built website designed, implemented and maintained to
replace the traditional lecture delivery. The online teaching model required
the online class student to check the website regularly, as the traditional
teaching model required the traditional class student to attend lectures
regularly. The website was formatted like a “book” of organized information
to be used as a class information resource. Students were required to use
Windows 95 and Office 97 for assignments. Email, the telephone, the Chat
feature and limited desktop video conferencing were used for communication
between students and the instructor.</p>
            <p>The interactive online course was started and completed by 11 students
from five accredited construction programs across the United States. Each
student enrolled in an elective or directed reading class with an assigned
faculty sponsor at their university. Invited faculty sponsors were initially
responsible for finding students in their programs interested in taking the
class. This method of recruitment was used due to the new and unproven
delivery method. Student reasons for taking the online class included interest
in taking an online course for the first time, using the class to conveniently
help fulfill their degree requirements or the content was not offered in their
program. The cns4913online class was the first comprehensive, semesterlength construction course to be offered by an Associated Schools of Construction (ASC) program to other ASC programs using the Internet. Participating construction programs included Oklahoma State, Texas A&M, Auburn, East Carolina and Cincinnati Universities.</p>
            <p>Students in the 1998 OU CNS 4913 lecture class did not have access to
the class website. Course content was delivered in lecture format requiring
note taking, but allowing for questions and observations. The delivery
sequence was the same for both classes. Students in both classes were given
the same homework assignments and exams at approximately the same times
during the semester. Class assessment for both groups was mostly closedbook and required a faculty proctor for all examinations. Online students were
given the same amount of time to complete their exams as the lecture class
students. Sponsor professors served in this capacity for their respective
students. The primary purpose of the parallel classes was for direct performance and administration comparison between the two delivery strategies.</p>
            <p>An interesting observation was made as the semester progressed. Lectures typically contained and followed information in the website. Traditional
students took notes during these lectures to be used for homework and exams.
The online students did not attend lectures, but actually obtained a better hardcopy set of notes than the students attending the traditional lectures by printing
the website pages for reference. This was not what the author envisioned at
the beginning of the class. The trade-off, obviously, is that the online students
missed the lecture class interaction reinforcing which information was the
most important. This class interaction was also a more convenient format in
which to answer questions.</p>
            <h2>The 1999 Class</h2>
            <p>Based upon this experience, in addition to the results of the CoA Course
Evaluations and subjective assessment gathered from students at the end of
the class, the website and class were upgraded. Prior to the start of the Spring</p>
